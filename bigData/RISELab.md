Real-time Intelligence with Secure Execution

### Context:

RISELab represents the next chapter in the ongoing story of data-intensive systems at Berkeley; a proactive step to move beyond Big Data analytics into a more immersive world. The RISE agenda begins by recognizing that there are big changes afoot:

* Sensors are everywhere. We carry them in our pockets, we embed them in our homes, we pass them on the street. Our world will be quantified, in fine detail, in real time.

* AI is for real. Big data and cheap compute finally made some of the big ideas of AI a practical reality. There’s a ton more to be done, but learning and prediction are now practical tools in the computing toolbox.

* The world is programmable. Our vehicles, houses, workplaces and medical devices are increasingly networked and programmable. The effects of computation are extending to include our homes, cities, airspace, and bloodstreams.

* In short, the loop between data generation, computation, and actuation is closing. And this is no longer a niche scenario: it’s going to be a standard mode of technology going forward.
