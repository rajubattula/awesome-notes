$ openstack endpoint list --interface public

$ openstack endpoint set --url <modified> <endpoint_id>

(where <modified> is the URL with the host part substituted with the
FQDN; and <endpoint_id> is the endpoint you are changing the URL for.

Once you've done that for all the public endpoints, you can restart all
the services:

$ service apache2 restart (this restarts keystone)
$ service nova-api restart
$ service neutron-server restart
