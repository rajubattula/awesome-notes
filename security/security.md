### side-channel analysis:
Electronic circuits produce a variety of emissions as byproducts of their processing that make it possible for an attacker without detailed knowledge of the actual structure of the circuitry itself to deduce what data it is processing. Heat and electromagnetic emissions are both viable sources of information for an attacker. As these emissions are side effects of operation, the use of them to perform reverse engineering has earned the term ‘side-channel analysis’.

### Monitoring Side-Channel Signals Could Detect Malicious Software on IoT Devices

The development of a new technique for wirelessly monitoring Internet of Things (IoT) devices for malicious software – without affecting the operation of the ubiquitous but low-power equipment

The technique will rely on receiving and analyzing side-channel signals, electromagnetic emissions that are produced unintentionally by the electronic devices as they execute programs. These signals are produced by semiconductors, capacitors, power supplies and other components, and can currently be measured up to a half-meter away from operating IoT devices.

By comparing these unintended side-channel emissions to a database of what the devices should be doing when they are operating normally, researchers can tell if malicious software has been installed.
